    "    \"Bypassing Safety Control\": \"Obtain authorization before overriding or disabling safety controls. Safety-critical equipment and procedures must be understood and utilized appropriately. Authorization must be obtained before disabling or overriding safety equipment, deviating from procedures, or crossing barriers. Safety-critical controls include equipment such as fire and explosion protection and mitigation systems, guards, interlocks, alarms, and safety-critical monitoring equipment designed to prevent fatalities or major accidents, limit their consequences, or prevent their substantial contribution to such incidents. Procedures that, if not performed correctly or at the right time, could result in fatalities or major accidents are also included.\"\n",
    "    \"Confined Space\": \"Obtain authorization before entering a confined space. Confirm that energy sources are isolated and the atmosphere has been tested and is monitored. Check and use breathing apparatus when required. Ensure an attendant is present, a rescue plan is in place, and authorization to enter is obtained. A confined space, such as a vessel, tank, pipe, cellar, or excavation, can contain explosive gas, toxic or asphyxiating atmosphere, or other dangers such as energy releases, lack of oxygen, exposure to hazardous chemicals, or risks of falling objects or falls. Authorized access ensures safety. Organizations should assess if any work involving excavations or trenches creates confined space conditions and ensure necessary work authorization and controls.\"\n",
    "    \"Driving Safety\": \"Follow safe driving rules, which include always wearing a seatbelt, not exceeding the speed limit, reducing speed appropriately for road conditions, not using phones or operating devices while driving, and being fit, rested, and fully alert. Adhere to journey management requirements. The driver and passengers should ensure each other's safety, including seatbelt use. Fitness for duty means ensuring the capability to complete a task safely without unacceptable risk, including not being under the influence of drugs and alcohol.\"\n",
    "    \"Energy Isolation\": \"Verify isolation and zero energy before work begins. Identify all energy sources, confirm hazardous energy sources are isolated, locked, and tagged, and check for zero energy and residual or stored energy. Energy isolation separates people from hazards such as electricity, pressure, and energized equipment, and provides protection from potential energy sources like gravity-fed tanks. Any stored energy (e.g., hydraulic or pneumatic power) should be dissipated before starting work.\"\n",
    "    \"Hot Work\": \"Control flammables and ignition sources. I identify and control ignition sources. Before starting any hot work I confirm flammable material has been removed or isolated, I obtain authorisation. Before starting hot work in a hazardous area I confirm that a gas test has been completed, and gas will be monitored continually. Hot work includes any work that creates an ignition source performed in an area which potentially contains hydrocarbons or flammable materials. Ignition sources are open flames or sources of heat that could ignite materials in the work area such as welding, grinding, smoking, torching, (un)loading of hazardous materials, internal combustion engines, chemical reactions, batteries, etc. Hazardous areas are defined in the UK Dangerous Substances and Explosive Atmospheres Regulations 2002 (DSEAR) as any place in which an explosive atmosphere may occur in quantities such as to require special precautions to protect the safety of workers.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   \"Line of Fire\": \"Keep yourself and others out of the line of fire. I position myself to avoid moving objects, vehicles, pressure releases, dropped objects. I establish and obey barriers and exclusion zones. I take action to secure loose objects and report potential dropped objects. Other rules focus on specific activities, whereas this Rule is intended to raise personal awareness of struck-by and caught in-between hazards. Line of fire hazards are not always obvious or constant and can be introduced as the task progresses (e.g. underground and overhead powerlines, pipelines, objects under pressure, stored energy, lines under tension, poorly supported excavations, shifting cargo, moving equipment). At all times individuals need to continually monitor their surroundings and position themselves to avoid being in the line of fire. This includes ensuring they are visible to vehicle drivers and equipment operators. Individuals recognise when they create a line of fire hazard and put others or themselves in the line of fire\"\n",
    "    \"Safe Mechanical Lifting\": \"Plan lifting operations and control the area. I confirm that the equipment and load have been inspected and are fit for purpose. I only operate equipment that I am qualified to use. I establish and obey barriers and exclusion zones. I never walk under a suspended load. Lifting operations need to be planned and performed by competent personnel using certified equipment. To protect people around suspended loads and any mechanical lifting operation, access should be controlled through physical barriers and exclusion zones. When mechanically lifting people (e.g. manriding, man baskets, personnel transfer, mobile elevated work platform), organisations should provide equipment which is designed and certified specifically for lifting people.\"\n",
    "    \"Work Authorisation\": \"Work with a valid permit when required. I have confirmed if a permit is required. I am authorised to perform the work. I understand the permit. I have confirmed that hazards are controlled and it is safe to start. I stop and reassess if conditions change. Work authorisation is more than just a person in charge signing a Permit to Work form: it is seeking and having authorisation to start, resume, or hand-over a task. The person in charge of the work confirms that it is safe to start, that controls are in place and effective, and the task can be performed as planned.\"\n",
    "    \"Working at Height\": \"Protect yourself against a fall when working at height. I inspect my fall protection equipment before use. I secure tools and work materials to prevent dropped objects. I tie off 100% to approved anchor points while outside a protected area. Working at height outside a protected area (such as an elevated work area not enclosed by hand rails) requires the use of approved fall protection equipment secured to an approved anchor point. Other considerations for working at height include ladders, work over water, rope access, floor openings, access hatches, and inspection pits. Floor openings should be protected with physical barriers to prevent falls. Preventing objects from falling from height and using physical barriers below working area keeps you and people working below you safe. IOGP recommends that companies define working at height as work at or above 1.8m/6ft, unless local legislation requires a lower height. Scaffolds should be properly constructed, inspected and certified.\"\n",
